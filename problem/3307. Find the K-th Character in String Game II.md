# Alice and Bob Game Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given an integer array `operations`, where `operations[i]` represents the **type** of the `iᵗʰ` operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform **all** operations in sequence:

- If `operations[i] == 0`, **append** a copy of `word` to itself.
- If `operations[i] == 1`, generate a new string by **changing** each character in `word` to its **next** character in the English alphabet, and **append** it to the *original* `word`.  
  For example:
    - `"c"` → `"cd"`
    - `"zb"` → `"zbac"`

> **Note:** The character `'z'` can be changed to `'a'` in the second type of operation.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
`k = 5`, `operations = [0, 0, 0]`

**Output:**  
`"a"`

**Explanation:**  
Initially, `word == "a"`. Alice performs the three operations as follows:

1. Append `"a"` to `"a"` → `word = "aa"`
2. Append `"aa"` to `"aa"` → `word = "aaaa"`
3. Append `"aaaa"` to `"aaaa"` → `word = "aaaaaaaa"`
---

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
`k = 10`, `operations = [0, 1, 0, 1]`

**Output:**  
`"b"`

**Explanation:**  
Initially, `word == "a"`. Alice performs the four operations as follows:

1. Append `"a"` to `"a"` → `word = "aa"`
2. Append `"bb"` to `"aa"` → `word = "aabb"`
3. Append `"aabb"` to `"aabb"` → `word = "aabbaabb"`
4. Append `"bbccbbcc"` to `"aabbaabb"` →  
   `word = "aabbaabbbbccbbcc"`

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= 10¹⁴`
- `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
- `operations[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
- The input is generated such that `word` has **at least** `k` characters after all operations.
